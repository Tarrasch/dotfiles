* have a case insensitive match mode - fx == fX
* arbitrary aliases - call fanfingtastic#assign_alias('x', 'xyz') to allow fx to match any of x, y or z.
  with this you could, for example:
    assign_alias('b', '()')
    assign_alias('B', '{}')

* expose next_char() as a global or through an autoload restructure

* When , or ; move backwards they are inclusive movements. Well, they shouldn't!
