__Find a char, across lines__

TIP: If you like Fanf,ingTastic; and want to share the W00t!, I'm grateful for
http://of-vim-and-vigor.blogspot.com/[beverages].

__Fanf,ingTastic;__ is a Vim plugin that enhances the builtin +F+ +f+ +,+ +T+ +t+
and +;+ keys by allowing them to wrap over lines with the full gamut of
normal, visual and operator pending mode supported. This is all the default
configuration of __Fanf,ingTastic;__ provides, however the following enhanced
functionality can be enabled through configuration options:

* **Case insensitivity** __Fanf,ingTastic;__ is case
  sensitive by default but can be set to ignore case so that +fx+ will
  match either ``x'' or ``X''.

* **Aliases** __Fanf,ingTastic;__ allows you to
  create aliases which specify a set of characters that will be
  scanned for when FfTt;, is used on that alias. For example:
+
  :FanfingTasticAlias b ()

  :FanfingTasticAlias B {}
+
would allow +fb+ to search forward to the next ``('' or ``)'' character (spanning
lines as necessary). Likewise, +TB+ would scan backwards (spanning lines) to
place the cursor just to the right hand side of the ``{'' or ``}'' character prior
to the cursor's current position. Of course, with both of these aliases
enabled, the user will not be able to find plain ``b'' or ``B'' characters with the
fFtT;, commands.

NOTE: Fan,fingTastic; depends on Tim Pope's [repeat] plugin for
accurate dot operator support in Vim. At this stage, the f,ing
commands cannot be composed with the dot operator within a `:norm`
command.
